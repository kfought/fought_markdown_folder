## To the Girl I Tutored at the Middle School
#### by Kaitlyn Burton

Has it already been years?

Today I find myself in another college class, creating projects involving my time tutoring at your middle school freshman year. It’s finally time to start unpacking these memories and ideas you and your fellow students gave me.

Memories and ideas that sunk into me and will never leave.

I would tell you that as much as I tutored you, you taught me more. You, and the other kids I worked with that year . . . you guys changed my life.

All those long hours laboring at classwork with you, trying in vain to raise you to grade level.

All those stories you'd tell.

Did you know I left in tears most of the time?

My heart couldn’t take the measure of hardship you’d already experienced; it poured into me with every word you said, and it broke me. Every single week.

Do you remember how I’d walk into the room before the bell and your face would light up like the sun? How I’d grab your work from your English teacher and we’d walk to the end of the hall, just you and me, kick off our shoes and tuck our legs under us on those wooden benches, with the long, warm windows at our backs? Do you remember the deals I’d make with you to keep you working, the ones where if you’d complete some number of problems, you could ask me any question you wanted? We spent so many Friday afternoon classes this way. Chipping away at your classwork. Talking about life.

You told me about your sister and the baby she was expecting, her boyfriend enlisting and heading to basic soon, your dad and how you were sure he loved you, how sometimes you didn’t know if Jesus was really there. I told you about my then-boyfriend, what I was doing at college, why on earth I was spending my time at this middle school, with these kids, with you.

You told me about the cuts on your arm and why you put them there, and one day when you had your arm wrapped up and down in gauze, I’d already been alerted by the guidance counselor, briefed on how sensitive I needed to be.

There was a lot going on behind closed doors that you wouldn’t talk about, or you’d minimize as if it weren’t really that bad. But any adult around you could see the impact.

We worked so hard that year to get you caught up. Sometimes I even met you in your remedial reading class, but it wasn’t enough for you to pass the state test, and I was crushed. I really thought you had it. But the truth is, you and so many other students I tutored were already so far behind. It didn’t come from your time in the 6th or 7th grade, or even from your days in elementary school.

For many of you, it started, or rather didn’t start, before you were old enough to go to school.

It began at home, where other kids grew up loved and safe and enjoyed bedtime stories. Where other kids had enough to eat and played outside and sometimes landed in time out and never had reason to know how bad the world is.

It started at home, where the students I worked with might have heard Daddy hitting Mommy in the next room. Where maybe they didn’t feel safe. Where being read to perhaps wasn’t something that happened for them. Where maybe nobody taught them right from wrong, or helped them manage the time in the day. Where they didn’t develop the mental framework that school would build on. Even when their parents wanted so badly to give them a good life, but life just got in the way.

It continued as the years went on. Other kids went home and had dinner with their families every night, did their homework when their parents told them to and went to bed when their parents told them to. While students like you perhaps came to school holding monstrous energy drinks, eyes drooping, grateful—deep down—for the consistency and calm of the school day. Maybe nobody told you to do your homework the night before so you didn’t. Maybe nobody told you when to go to bed, but conditions in your home weren’t favorable for sleeping peacefully anyway. Maybe you had a hard time fitting in with others your age because most pre-teens, faced with changing bodies, relationship struggles, and middle school drama don’t parent themselves. Maybe you had a hard time because “home” was tumultuous and you had no real fulfillment of your basic needs for safety, comfort, and care.

You didn’t all have the same story, but your individual stories seemed to have the same effects.

You were already behind before you even started.

But this is how our culture looks at you: Troubled. Lazy. Dumb. Failure.

“Destined to flip burgers the rest of her life.”

You must be in high school now, and I hope you haven’t dropped out or tried that stuff on your arm again. I hope you have teachers and counselors who fight for you behind the scenes as hard as your middle school ones did.

I have this hope for you because you have purpose in this life. You are valuable. Even if you don’t get good grades. Even if it isn’t really your fault.

You can change things about this world by helping other girls in these situations. You can tell them how cutting never really helped, how school was hard and other kids didn’t understand, how you plan to break cycles with your life, make different choices than the ones society thinks you’ll make. You can change this world. You can fight for a better life. You can fight for a better image and a better education for those who come after you.

You have a story to tell, a story worth hearing.

And whether you fight for the power to share it, I will keep telling your story, the story of the kids I tutored and mentored at the middle school, the ones who didn’t come from the perfect life, the ones who were strong and broken and trying to deal with it in all their own ways.

The ones we can’t afford to forget.

## Inside Knowledge of a Middle School Guidance Counselor
#### An interview and thought piece by Kaitlyn Burton

I had the pleasure of sitting down with Cindy Martin, one of the guidance counselors at [Christiansburg Middle School](http://cms.mcps.org/) in Christiansburg, Virginia, who was my supervisor and mentor when I tutored at CMS a few years ago.

For another look at my experience there, check out my other blog post, [“To the Girl I Tutored at the Middle School”](https://medium.com/@embarkwebsite/to-the-girl-i-tutored-at-the-middle-school-ee2c42cb02b5).

Cindy has worked at CMS for 6 years, and has basically seen it all. A normal workload, for her, may consist of maintaining legal documents for children needing accommodations, meeting with troubled and academically-behind children or children from unstable family situations, referring kids to counseling, planning the anti-bullying program, mediating between students, parents, and teachers, working with administration to help correct behavioral issues in students, helping 8th graders develop four-year plans for high school, connecting tutors to classrooms, teachers, and needy students . . . the list goes on. Cindy has a wealth of knowledge about school dynamics!

I talked with Cindy and picked her brain on some important topics I gained exposure to when I tutored at CMS: how does home socioeconomic status affect student performance? How does the home life in general affect kids when they come to school? Some of her answers surprised me, and may surprise you, too. Take a look:

> **K: In your experience, how does psychological state of mind, the home life, money, things like that—how do those affect student performance?**

> C: Oh. It’s like…it affects everything.

> **K: It’s a big thing to unpack.**

> C: Well, and the thing is, if you think about \[Maslow's\] hierarchy of values. You know, we have to feel safe, and have our basic needs met. We think food and water, right? Well...for a middle school student, a basic need is that they feel like they have a parent or some adult that cares about them. Just cares about them. They need to feel safe. They need to feel loved. Yes; they need food, and they need healthy food. And they also need a parent that’s going to give them some parameters to live in. And when they don’t have those things, and when they don’t have stability, then they’re coming to school angry. They’re coming to school exhausted. That parenting piece, when it’s missing, and when the home life, the stability of the home life is missing, then they know they can’t learn. And then they become behavioral problems, so then they get kicked out of class, and then they’re going home, which is the worst thing in the world. . . . For some families, the school kind of becomes the parent. The school becomes the caretaker. . . . But if they’re not feeling safe and they don’t feel like what they’re going to go home to something good—they’ll close down. And if you look at statistics . . . the overriding thing for our lower academically, low-performance kids—

> **K: Is money.**

> C: Is money.

> **K: At home.**

> C: At home. It’s poverty. It’s poverty . . . So, those things are important. It does impact children. Now that can be, though, somebody who’s very rich to somebody who’s very poor. If you’ve got an unstable family, if you’ve got a child going through a divorce, or a parent dies, or whatever, those are kids that are in crisis, and they do need help. Some of them are going to handle it better than others, but some of them really need help to get through those things.

> **K: Yeah. Because . . . kids can’t parent themselves.**

> C: No. Although, some of them do.

> **K: But for the most part, try being a barely pubescent middle schooler—like nobody has a good middle school experience as it is. Middle school sucks.**

> C: It’s really hard.

> **K: And so try navigating all those new relationships and a body that’s completely changing on you—and try to make yourself do your homework.**

> C: Mhmm.

> **K: And make yourself check over your homework and make sure it’s right. You know, make yourself have good study, time management, stress-coping skills.**

> C: A big push for us is to try to get them to school, and it’s hard. It’s really hard. So if you’ve got this instability and you’ve got a parent that didn’t wake up, then you’ve got a student that has to set their own alarm, and they’ve got to get up and get out to the bus, and they don’t always do that in 6th, 7th, and 8th grades. Those are hard things. But some of them do it. And the other thing you find is, some of them *want* to be at school. We have a lot of things that happen, usually on Mondays after they’ve been at home, or Fridays, right before they go home. Before breaks, we see a lot of stuff heightened with kids’ anxiety and sadness, because they know \[at school\] they’re cared for, and they know that somebody will know whether they’re okay the next day. School does that. Cause if they don’t come, we’re going to find out why.

> **K: So school’s a bit of a refuge, then.**

> C: I see it as that.

> **K:Have you ever seen students so far behind academically that they just give up?**

> C: All the time. Every day. In their remediation classes, sometimes they’ll be passing those, and they won’t pass another class.

> **K: They just feel like they’ll never catch up?**

> C: It’s hard to catch up; yeah. Now I like the remediation, especially Read 180 \[remedial reading class\] because they set goals, and they can test out, and they make it very celebratory. But I always feel sorry for the 8th grader who’s still in Read 180. But you know, the goal is to try to get them up for high school. Now what really needs to happen is they need to be up before they come to us. They need to catch those kids and really I think that’s getting better, so that when we’re in 6th grade, we don’t have 30 kids who are not on reading level, or 50 kids who are not on reading level.

> **K: But you inherit a lot of children who are behind already.**

> C: Mhmm. Yeah. And that’s been talked about within the school system. I know they’re trying to do that better. Cause there’s Title I and different programs that they try. But you don’t catch them all and if they go to a different school every year, and if they’re absent, they’re going to have huge gaps.

> **K: And a lot slipping through the cracks, right?**

> C: Oh, absolutely, yeah.

> **K: Well, that’s all my questions. Anything else you’d like to add?**

> C: My biggest thing is we need somebody on high to realize that our school’s great, but they’re not reaching our lower kids. We need schools to come at it a little bit differently, and focus a lot less on \[the state standardized tests\] and a lot more on getting them ready, and training them to be able to live on their own and be able to work. I think our whole society would be better, because if we do that, then they’re not going to jail, because they’ve got a job. They’re not going to have to steal. They’re not going to have to sell drugs. They’ll have shadowed, and they’re pushing that, too: shadowing in their junior and senior year. The school superintendent wants to do that; he wants to have these kids shadow. That, to me, is the key for some of our kids. I just don’t want it to have to wait till high school, because that 9th grade year is when a lot of them drop out, so you want to get them before that. So I’d love to have, if we’re already targeting those kids and they’re way behind, let’s have something cool for them. I truly don’t know what that looks like, but there would be a huge benefit of that. I don’t play the lottery but if I could do something with lottery money, I would try to create a school like that. There’s no failing. There’s no failure. There’s no, “I’m not gonna work.” We’d have all the methods. We’d have some leeway to get those kids to do stuff, and to learn. On their level. And teach them a trade. Or teach them to help other people. These kids just don’t have purpose, you know?

> **K: Yeah. It’s either college or you’re a failure.**

> C: Yeah. It’s like, “Well I’m not going to college so I’ll just create as much drama as I can possibly create in these years that I have.” You know, it’s sad.


It turns out that above and beyond any factor, stability at home plays the biggest role in grade students’ lives. This surprised me; I thought that money would be the most important factor, and while it’s closely tied to stability of the home life, as a lot of struggling families are [more likely to have instability issues at home](http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/education.aspx), it can affect students from wealthier backgrounds, too.

Another important thing to note is that schools are inheriting kids who are already significantly behind their peers academically. It’s already been demonstrated that [learning starts well before the time students enter grade school](http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/education.aspx). By the time they reach the CMS counselors' radar, they’ve potentially been trying to catch up for *years*. At CMS, the school works closely with these students, trying very hard to raise them to grade level through remedial reading and math classes (Read 180 and Math 180) and tutoring, because their 9th grade year will be the prime time they’ll drop out of grade school.

So with such complicated issues, how can we help these students better? Does the answer lie in pre-grade school programs like [Head Start](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ohs)? Do we send these students to trade schools so we don’t push college on them if they aren’t college-bound? Do we ditch standardization and develop a wide range of measuring sticks—evaluations that don’t necessarily tell a non-academic student that they’re a failure because they aren’t doing well in classes? Do we focus on teaching them work skills that may be more practical?

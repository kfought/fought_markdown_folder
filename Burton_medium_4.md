##The Next Town Over
####by Kaitlyn Burton

I lived my most formative adolescent years in a little town called [Blacksburg](https://www.mapquest.com/us/va/blacksburg-282039212), in Southwest Virginia. Most of you won’t know where that is until I say two keywords: Virginia Tech.

Blacksburg is a thriving, and growing, little town made up of an odd mix of rural, country areas and a massive limestone university, connected by little swaths of “town.” Often bathed in maroon and orange, Blacksburg is impossible to separate from Virginia Tech, but us townies will tell you that there’s a certain kind of way to do it. As the town expands and contracts seasonally, shrinking by probably half its population during the summer, winter, Thanksgiving, and spring breaks, waves of townies either embrace the college culture or avoid town for most of the year, coming crawling back out to restaurants and the like only when students aren’t in town. We all know how to take the back roads to avoid game day and graduation traffic.

But while it’s possible to avoid the university, many in Blacksburg spend their professional days on campus or nearby, working jobs affiliated with Virginia Tech. My own family moved here when my mom enrolled in the medical school that sprouted off of the university. Parents of kids I went to school with worked as professors, administrators, deans, associates, and directors at Virginia Tech, and countless others worked local jobs that wouldn’t otherwise be here without the college. The whole town, generally, is built on education.

You can’t live in a town like that and not expect a high bar to be set for its local schools. My high school always felt like a place where excellence was expected and falling short of it was the outlier rather than the norm. Most of my peers were taking AP and Dual-Enrollment classes, and gaining credits for college before they even graduated high school. Many of the people I knew had GPA’s upwards of 4.0. The big downside of an environment like that is that not everyone can handle that kind of pressure. But that’s a post for another day.

The dynamics of the areas surrounding Virginia Tech are such that the farther out you are from those limestone buildings, the less affiliated you probably are with the university. The areas become more rural, more laid-back, and more of what you might expect for smaller, country towns in Southwest Virginia. The closest town over is Christiansburg Virginia, just a short drive from Blacksburg.

Blacksburg’s and Christiansburg’s high schools sit just [8.5 miles](https://www.mapquest.com/directions/list/1/us/virginia/schools-blacksburg/blacksburg-high-school-353936127/to/us/virginia/schools-christiansburg/christiansburg-high-school-305948682) from each other, but they couldn’t be more different. While Blacksburg kids are mostly tied to Virginia Tech in one way or another, most Christiansburg kids aren’t; their families work in Christiansburg, which simply doesn’t have the same standard of living without a massive college smack in the middle demanding expansion and economic growth. I never realized until I started attending Virginia Tech and found myself tutoring at Christiansburg Middle School just how different these two school systems can be.

According to [U.S. News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/virginia/rankings), while Blacksburg boasts a nice 92% graduation rate, Christiansburg falls behind it by a whole 10%, at 82%. That’s almost a 5th of the students at Christiansburg dropping out, and I have heard from one of the guidance counselors at Christiansburg Middle School that many of the dropouts will take place during the 9th grade. That’s astonishing to a student like me. And while Blacksburg High School is awarded a score of 57.7 on U.S. News & World Report’s College Readiness Index, Christiansburg High School’s score is 15.5. [The College Readiness Index](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings) measures the number of students at each school enrolled in AP and college equivalent classes, as well as how they’re doing in them. This means that if there are nearly 58 out of every hundred students at BHS taking college-level courses in high school, there are only about 16 from every hundred doing the same at CHS.

Racial demographics don’t seem to make much, if any impact; the demographics listed for [BHS](http://www.greatschools.org/virginia/blacksburg/1093-Blacksburg-High-School/#Students) and [CHS](http://www.greatschools.org/virginia/christiansburg/1095-Christiansburg-High-School/#Students) on greatschools.com appear roughly the same. And yet, on schooldigger.com, [Blacksburg High School](https://www.schooldigger.com/go/VA/district/02520/search.aspx) is ranked the 53rd school in the state, while [Christiansburg](https://www.schooldigger.com/go/VA/schools/0252001019/school.aspx), so close by geographically, is ranked significantly lower, at 137th.

The statistic that makes the most difference, then? The socioeconomic levels of the students attending the schools. According to schooldigger.com, at [Blacksburg High School](https://www.schooldigger.com/go/VA/district/02520/search.aspx), around 17% of the student population is on the free/reduced lunch program, which is provided to all students whose families are less likely to afford school lunch. But at [Christiansburg High School](https://www.schooldigger.com/go/VA/schools/0252001019/school.aspx), the number jumps nearly 20%, to 36% of students enrolled in free/reduced lunch.

I never knew these things growing up. All I ever knew about CHS was that its football team kicked our butts almost every year. I had a sense that Christiansburg kids were tougher than we were; more “ghetto” was the mentality that floated through my school (that’s what I heard, not what I would personally call it). I knew that in every rival football game in which Christiansburg beat us, our student section would start chanting, “S-A-T’s! \*clap, clap, clap-clap-clap\*” in response. So I knew that we had better test scores than they did, but I never really thought about it much (or came to hate that chant as much as I do today).

It wasn’t until my freshman year of college at Virginia Tech that I started to gain a first-hand account of what many students go through at Christiansburg schools. It’s a tougher home life there, whether it’s parents working so much to make ends meet that they can’t spend much time with their kids, or being raised by grandparents because parents are incarcerated, or coming to school hungry, or not knowing when Mom or Dad will be violently drunk or high next. That’s not to say all students experience these things, of course. But many more of them did there than they did where I went to school.

It just astounds me that this can even be the case. A school so close in proximity to mine, and only 7.7 miles from the university that brings in so much wealth and knowledge to Blacksburg . . . and yet faring so much worse than the school right next door.

It simply isn’t okay. It’s unacceptable. We, as a local community, should be able to do better, should be able to spread the effects of the store of knowledge and passionate learning that is Virginia Tech, and yet, there’s still so much of a gap.

A wide, gaping, complicated gap of only [7.7](https://www.mapquest.com/directions/list/1/us/virginia/virginia-tech-university-358222276/to/us/virginia/schools-christiansburg/christiansburg-high-school-305948682) miles.

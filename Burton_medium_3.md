## Equal Schooling in the United States of America
#### by Kaitlyn Burton

I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to write about for this post. I mean, I have to write it because it’s for a university class, and I have to write it on education in America, specifically lower-income education, because that’s what my group’s focus is on.

But what could I write about education when it seems everything’s already been said? Don’t we talk in circles enough these days?

I took to the Internet and stumbled upon a [Prince Ea](http://princeea.com/) video I’ve seen before called [“I JUST SUED THE SCHOOL SYSTEM !!!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqTTojTija8) For those who don’t know, Prince Ea is a spoken-word poet whose work in multimedia poetry and video have gained a lot of attention to browsers of the Internet in the last several years. He’s big on making stand-out pieces that really grip the viewer.

The basic idea of his piece is that we expect the same things of all students, that even the “fish” are expected to “climb a tree,” in the outdated system of American education. Whether we think the public school system is outdated or not, I think we can all agree that at some point, we’ve felt this whole fish-tree thing: “I’m never going to use this kind of math in my future career” is probably the most common complaint I've heard in my school years. And just for the record, I *haven’t* used basically anything from my later-high school math classes in the entire 4-6 years since I’ve learned it (and forgotten it—sorry, Mrs. Delpercio; you tried).

Price Ea mentions some other school systems he says are doing education so much better than us—one of these being Finland.

Apparently, [Finland has some kick-butt schools](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/why-are-finlands-schools-successful-49859555/) and an impressive high school graduation rate—93% to our 75.5%.  They have zero government-mandated standardized tests (the horror!). In at least one school, they give students 15 minutes of outdoor play in between every lesson, because “play is important.”

If you’re from the United States and reading my measly blog article, can you imagine? No standardized tests. Spending the entire school year *really* learning life skills and useful head knowledge—the actual curriculum of what they want you to know by the end of the year— instead of (in the end) how to pass the test. Being allowed legitimate breaks throughout the day to recharge your brain and prepare for your next lesson. Receiving real individualized attention from teachers who aren’t as burnt out from managing so many students and trying desperately to keep up with federal standards, with so little paycheck to live on, and with their jobs on the line if their students don’t test well.

(A note here: please don't read me wrong; many teachers I've met throughout my life, both in school and while I've volunteered in schools, have been great. They care about their students to an astonishing degree, and they do as much as they can to give them the individualized attention they need. I'm talking about the overall culture of what we're doing to teachers in the U.S.: overburdening, underpaying, and unfairly measuring.)

But maybe this isn’t even your experience. I took an informal survey on one of my social media sites asking for people’s opinions about public education in the United States, and the overwhelming response from most was that it’s hard to answer because it depends. It depends on location, district, state, and income level of those who make up the school.

We want to make education so standardized, so much the “same,” but right now, education couldn’t be farther from equal.

Take it with a grain of salt since it’s just a social media comment stream, but think about how many times you’ve heard someone say, “I came from a really good school” or “I came from a really bad school.” There’s a great discrepancy implied there.

Even in my own region, I went to the “good” school, and there was a “bad” school less than 10 miles away (check out my blog post about that: (I'll insert this link once I get the 4th medium post onto the internet)), whose attendees came from, on average, much poorer families, and were (and still are today) more likely to find themselves behind academically, perform worse on state standardized tests, and drop out of high school, usually during their freshman year.

It’s astonishing how we can be so “standard” and yet so different, isn’t it?
